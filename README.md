# HackDavis2025 Project: UC Davis Study Buddy
A webpage that provides recommendations to UC Davis students based on their queries.

## Description
UC Davis Study Buddy is a web application designed to help students navigate campus life more effectively. It provides recommendations for study resources, places to eat, mental health resources, entertainment options, and more based on user queries. The project aims to be a one-stop solution for common student needs at UC Davis.
   - Recommendations: Recommend me resources and places to study [academic topic goes here]
   - Entertainment: I want to drink boba, recommend me a place
   - Study: I want to find a quiet space, recommend me a place on campus/off-campus
   - Mental Health: I am feeling overwhelmed, where should I go to relax? 
   - Music: I want some soft music to help me concentrate on homework
   - Food: I want to eat a burger, where to eat?
   - Social Hub - Letting your fellow students know about events or things happening on campus, like "there are ducks by the Silo right now!"
