# HackDavis_Project

## Idea: UC Davis Study Buddy
1. A web that user can enter their query, like,
   - Recommendations: Recommend me resources to study [academic topic goes here]
   - Entertainment: I want to drink boba, recommend me a place
   - Study: I want to find a quiet space, recommend me a place on campus/off-campus
   - Mental Health: I am feeling overwhelmed, where should I go to relax? 
   - Music: I want some soft music to help me concernate on homework
   - Food: I want to burger, where to eat?
   - Social Hub - Letting your fellow students know about events or things happening on campus, like "there are ducks by the silo right now!"
